# RustIRCd Operator Flags Reference

## Overview

RustIRCd implements a **granular operator permission system** based on flags. Instead of a single "operator" privilege level, administrators can combine specific flags to create operators with precisely the permissions they need. This follows the principle of **least privilege** and allows for fine-grained access control.

## Architecture

The operator system follows a **modular architecture**:

- **Operator Flags** are defined in `core` (`core/src/config.rs`) - used by all commands
- **Flag Definitions** are in `core/src/user.rs` - part of the User struct  
- **OPER Authentication** is handled by the **oper module** (`modules/src/oper.rs`)
- **Flag Checking** is done in core commands (SQUIT, KILL, CONNECT, etc.)

This means:
- ‚úÖ Operator flags are **always available** (core functionality)
- ‚úÖ OPER command requires the **oper module** to be loaded
- ‚úÖ Commands like SQUIT, KILL, CONNECT check flags directly (no module needed)
- ‚úÖ Configuration is in `config.toml` (operators section)

**To enable operator authentication:**
```toml
# config.toml
[modules]
enabled_modules = ["oper", "channel", "ircv3"]  # Include "oper"
```

Without the oper module, users cannot authenticate as operators (OPER command unavailable), but operator flag checking still works for any users who have flags set through other means.

## Available Operator Flags

### üåê GlobalOper
**Full operator privileges network-wide**

- **Can KILL any user** on any server in the network
- Can perform operator commands globally
- Highest privilege level for user management
- Required for network-wide moderation

**Use cases:**
- Head administrators
- Network moderators
- Global abuse handlers

**Security note:** Grant sparingly - allows killing any user anywhere.

---

### üè† LocalOper
**Operator privileges limited to local server only**

- **Can KILL users** connected to the local server only
- Cannot affect remote servers or users
- Good for server-specific moderation
- Safer than GlobalOper for most staff

**Use cases:**
- Server administrators
- Local moderators
- Server-specific support staff

**Security note:** Safer than GlobalOper - limited blast radius.

---

### üîó RemoteConnect
**Can use /CONNECT to link remote servers**

- Can establish **server-to-server connections** from anywhere
- Can connect servers that are not directly linked
- Required for network topology management
- Allows connecting third-party servers to the network

**Use cases:**
- Hub administrators
- Network topology managers
- Senior staff managing network structure

**Security note:** Powerful - can reshape network topology.

---

### üè† LocalConnect
**Can use /CONNECT to link servers from local server**

- Limited to connecting **from this server only**
- Cannot manage remote server connections
- Cannot force remote servers to connect to others
- Useful for leaf server administrators

**Use cases:**
- Local server administrators
- Operators who need to reconnect their own servers
- Limited server management roles

**Security note:** Safer than RemoteConnect - limited scope.

---

### üëë Administrator
**Enhanced administrative privileges**

- **Can see secret channels** in /WHOIS (+s channels)
- Access to additional server information
- Enhanced visibility for troubleshooting
- Does NOT grant KILL or SQUIT privileges

**Use cases:**
- Senior staff members
- Support staff needing enhanced visibility
- Services administrators

**Security note:** Information only - no destructive powers.

---

### üïµÔ∏è Spy
**Notified when users /WHOIS them**

- Receives alerts when someone queries their information
- Privacy/security feature for high-profile operators
- Helps detect potential targeting or surveillance
- Does NOT grant any additional privileges

**Use cases:**
- High-profile operators
- Security-conscious administrators
- Network owners

**Security note:** Information only - no additional privileges.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Squit
**Can use /SQUIT to disconnect servers**

- Can **forcibly remove servers** from the network
- Causes network splits and disconnections
- Powerful and potentially destructive
- Required for emergency network management

**Use cases:**
- Senior network administrators
- Hub administrators
- Emergency response operators

**Security note:** DANGEROUS - can split the entire network. Grant with extreme caution.

---

## Configuration Examples

### Example 1: Complete Network Administrator
```toml
[[network.operators]]
nickname = "netadmin"
password_hash = "5e884898da28047151d0e56f8dc6292773603d0d6aabbdd62a11ef721d1542d8"
hostmask = "*@*.admin.example.com"
flags = ["GlobalOper", "RemoteConnect", "Administrator", "Squit", "Spy"]
enabled = true
```

### Example 2: Local Server Admin
```toml
[[network.operators]]
nickname = "serveradmin"
password_hash = "5e884898da28047151d0e56f8dc6292773603d0d6aabbdd62a11ef721d1542d8"
hostmask = "*@localhost"
flags = ["LocalOper", "LocalConnect", "Administrator"]
enabled = true
```

### Example 3: Hub Administrator
```toml
[[network.operators]]
nickname = "hubadmin"
password_hash = "5e884898da28047151d0e56f8dc6292773603d0d6aabbdd62a11ef721d1542d8"
hostmask = "*@*.hubs.example.com"
flags = ["LocalOper", "RemoteConnect", "Squit"]
enabled = true
```

### Example 4: Global Moderator
```toml
[[network.operators]]
nickname = "globalmod"
password_hash = "5e884898da28047151d0e56f8dc6292773603d0d6aabbdd62a11ef721d1542d8"
hostmask = "*@*.staff.example.com"
flags = ["GlobalOper"]
enabled = true
```

### Example 5: Local Moderator
```toml
[[network.operators]]
nickname = "localmod"
password_hash = "5e884898da28047151d0e56f8dc6292773603d0d6aabbdd62a11ef721d1542d8"
hostmask = "*@*.example.com"
flags = ["LocalOper"]
enabled = true
```

---

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Use Restrictive Hostmasks
Always use the most restrictive hostmask possible:

**Good:**
```toml
hostmask = "admin@192.168.1.100"           # Specific IP
hostmask = "admin@*.admin.example.com"     # Specific subdomain
hostmask = "*@staff.example.com"           # Specific host
```

**Bad:**
```toml
hostmask = "*@*"                           # Anyone from anywhere!
```

### 2. Follow Least Privilege Principle
Only grant the flags actually needed:

**Good:**
- Local moderator ‚Üí `["LocalOper"]`
- Server admin ‚Üí `["LocalOper", "LocalConnect", "Administrator"]`
- Network admin ‚Üí All flags as needed

**Bad:**
- Giving `["GlobalOper", "Squit"]` to everyone
- Granting `RemoteConnect` and `Squit` without `Oper` flags

### 3. Dangerous Flag Combinations
Be careful with these:

```toml
flags = ["Squit"]                          # Can split network but cannot reconnect!
flags = ["RemoteConnect", "Squit"]         # Can manage topology but not users
flags = ["GlobalOper", "Squit"]            # Very powerful - use with caution
```

### 4. Generate Secure Password Hashes
Never use plain text passwords:

```bash
# SHA256 hash (supported)
echo -n "your_secure_password" | sha256sum

# Use long, random passwords
openssl rand -base64 32 | sha256sum
```

### 5. Audit Operator Actions
Enable comprehensive logging for:
- `/OPER` - Who authenticates
- `/KILL` - Who kills whom
- `/SQUIT` - Who disconnects servers
- `/CONNECT` - Who establishes server links

### 6. Regular Audits
- Review operator list quarterly
- Remove unused operator accounts
- Update hostmasks when staff IP ranges change
- Rotate passwords periodically

## Command Permission Matrix

| Command | GlobalOper | LocalOper | RemoteConnect | LocalConnect | Admin | Spy | Squit |
|---------|-----------|-----------|---------------|--------------|-------|-----|-------|
| `/KILL` (local) | ‚úì | ‚úì | - | - | - | - | - |
| `/KILL` (remote) | ‚úì | ‚úó | - | - | - | - | - |
| `/CONNECT` (remote) | - | - | ‚úì | ‚úó | - | - | - |
| `/CONNECT` (local) | - | - | ‚úì | ‚úì | - | - | - |
| `/SQUIT` | - | - | - | - | - | - | ‚úì |
| `/WHOIS` (see secret) | - | - | - | - | ‚úì | - | - |
| WHOIS notification | - | - | - | - | - | ‚úì | - |

**Legend:**
- ‚úì = Permission granted
- ‚úó = Permission denied (attempted action fails)
- \- = Not applicable

---

## Testing Operator Permissions

To test different permission levels:

```bash
# 1. Connect to server
telnet localhost 6667

# 2. Register
NICK testuser
USER testuser 0 * :Test User

# 3. Authenticate as operator
OPER nickname password

# 4. Test various commands
KILL someuser :Abuse                    # Test kill permission
SQUIT remote.server.com :Maintenance    # Test squit permission
CONNECT hub.example.com 6668            # Test connect permission
WHOIS someuser                          # Test info visibility
```

Expected results based on flags:
- **GlobalOper**: All KILL commands succeed
- **LocalOper**: Only local KILL succeeds, remote fails
- **Squit**: SQUIT succeeds
- **No Squit**: SQUIT fails with ERR_NOPRIVILEGES
- **Administrator**: See secret channels in WHOIS
- **Spy**: Receive notification when someone does /WHOIS on you

---

## Troubleshooting

### "ERR_NOPRIVILEGES" when trying to SQUIT
**Cause:** Operator doesn't have `Squit` flag.

**Solution:** Add `"Squit"` to the operator's flags in config.toml:
```toml
flags = ["GlobalOper", "Squit"]
```

### Operator can KILL locally but not remotely
**Cause:** Operator has `LocalOper` instead of `GlobalOper`.

**Solution:** Change `"LocalOper"` to `"GlobalOper"` if global kill is needed.

### Cannot see secret channels in WHOIS
**Cause:** Operator doesn't have `Administrator` flag.

**Solution:** Add `"Administrator"` to the operator's flags.

### CONNECT command fails
**Cause:** Operator doesn't have `RemoteConnect` or `LocalConnect` flag.

**Solution:** Add appropriate connect flag to operator's configuration.

## Migration from Traditional IRC Operators

Traditional IRC servers typically have a single "operator" privilege level. Here's how to migrate:

### Traditional Single-Level Operators
```toml
# Old style: Everyone is the same
flags = ["GlobalOper"]
```

### Modern Granular Permissions
```toml
# Network admin
flags = ["GlobalOper", "RemoteConnect", "Administrator", "Squit"]

# Server admin
flags = ["LocalOper", "LocalConnect", "Administrator"]

# Moderator
flags = ["LocalOper"]
```

---

## Conclusion

RustIRCd's granular operator flag system provides fine-grained control over operator permissions. By combining different flags, you can create operators with precisely the privileges they need, following security best practices and the principle of least privilege.
